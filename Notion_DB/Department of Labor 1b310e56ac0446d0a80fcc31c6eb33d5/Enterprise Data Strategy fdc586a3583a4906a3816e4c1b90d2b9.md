FOREWORD
Let me thank the amazing public servants who helped craft this inaugural data strategy for the Department of Labor, in
particular our Chief Data Officer Scott Gibbons and the entire team at our Office of Data Governance, along with our Chief
Innovation Officer Chike Aguh.
Since I came to the department, I have asked my team to unleash their full power—to take every tool, our statutory
authority, rules and regulations, funding, and the incredible talent we have across the country and unleash it every single
day for the good of America’s working people.
Too often, an assumption in government is, I need a change in the law to do this, or the only way to make a real impact
is with more money, or if I could hire more people, we could make this happen, instead of focusing on the tremendous
power we already have and the many ways we are not fully utilizing it in service to our mission. This includes examining
all the ways we have tied our own hands, interpreted policies and authorities too narrowly, been too afraid to try a new
way of operating. In assessing organizational risk, I ask that we examine not just the risk of certain activities—which is
important—but the risk of not acting.
Data is truly one of the superpowers of the Department of Labor. That superpower allows us to move the needle on
critical goals for American workers:
• Job Quality: Since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, it has been clear that one of the most important
tasks before us is getting Americans back to work (or into work for the first time) after the pandemic. We resolved
to help provide them with not just any jobs, but quality jobs that pay family sustaining wages; ensure security,
dignity and respect; and provide a path to the American Dream. This is why the department worked to create the
first-of-its-kind Job Quality Measurement Initiative with various foundations to define and advance job quality at
scale across our economy.
• Equity: As evidenced by President Biden signing his Executive Order on Equity on day one and by our
department’s equity strategy, we are committed to ensuring that every American worker is protected, respected
and advancing in this economy. To do this, we are lifting up the needs and voices of workers from communities
who have been overlooked: workers of color, immigrants, women, workers with disabilities, those living in
concentrated poverty, and those in rural and/or low-income communities. We do this not simply because it is the
right thing to do but because building an inclusive economy measured by the experiences of these workers is the
way to make sure no one is left behind. Data is critical to fulfilling our aims here. In addition to planning our work
through the collection and evaluation of reliable data, we are committed to making data available. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics is now publishing monthly jobs data on Native American and Native Alaskan workers and
working on disaggregating demographic data for the nation’s Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
communities, which are diverse and have different needs and economic outcomes.
This data strategy builds on these examples and many others happening all over the department. Per our strategy, we
will make our data findable by anyone, accessible to all, interoperable across siloes, and reusable across time. Beyond
that, we will work to find ways to put this data into the hands of workers themselves, to empower them to make
decisions that will improve their lives.
Ending where I began, I want to thank all those who worked to bring this strategy to life, and I want to offer even
deeper thanks to those who will use this data to improve life for all of us. We will unleash the full power of data at the
Department of Labor and leverage it on behalf of the workers we serve. Thank you.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This data strategy guides current and prospective efforts
across the Department of Labor (DOL) to create and
improve capabilities that support better alignment of data
operations, more effective data management, and greater
use of data to inform program administration and decisionmaking. Aligning disparate data definitions, collections, and
management processes to allow their products to integrate
and function effectively is a challenge, but one with clear
solutions that require a unified approach to improving data,
people, culture, analytics, and technology. By identifying
clear and realistic goals that are expected to bring value by
harmonizing and optimizing data operations, working to
improve data governance through objective measures of
progress and value, and improving data production, DOL
builds capabilities for data to inform and support decision
making.
This three-year strategy builds off the foundation of missions
and laws that guide the Department and is composed of
four guiding principles and five goals that can develop
more consistent and effective data governance and align
Departmental and agency planning to improve data
management and use capabilities. The four guiding principles
are (1) making data findable, (2) making data accessible, (3)
making data interoperable, and (4) making data reusable;
or the FAIR principles for short. The five strategic goals are:
(1) ensuring data are managed to be open by default, (2)
ensuring data are comprehensible, (3) ensuring data are fit
for purpose, (4) ensuring data are available in consistent and
predictable ways, and (5) managing data as an enterprise
asset, incorporate stakeholder input, and as appropriate,
made public in ways that provide real benefit to data users.
Taken together, the foundation, principles, and goals form
a strategy that should guide decision-making, project
planning, and data governance, and incrementally improve
the state of data at DOL. The strategy concludes with focused
areas for improvement at the agency and Departmental
levels including (1) ensuring data quality, (2) building and
maintaining data talent, (3) integration of data into existing
agency management and planning systems to create a
practical and realizable path forward, and (4) expanding the
data capabilities for producing sophisticated analytics.

BACKGROUND FOR
THE DOL DATA
STRATEGY
DOL is composed of agencies with varying missions,
programs, and organizational structures, with each
producing data in response to diverse mandates, laws,
and policies. Creating data that can serve as a strategic
asset across such an enterprise requires a strong focus
on the quality, availability, and utility of such data. Data
products that are consistent in format and content
increase value by making it easier to find patterns and
trends that are relevant to program administration, and
reduce the costs and complexity of analysis through
efficient and predictable use. High-quality data are
essential to understanding the effectiveness of DOL
programs, the beneficiaries and stakeholders impacted
by those programs, and the degree to which we meet our
missions.
Numerous factors shape the manner and extent to which
Federal agencies leverage data as a strategic asset: the
laws and policies governing data they generate or use;
the missions, methods, and stakeholders; the capabilities
in the data infrastructure; and their organizational data
culture. Data culture is a particularly important factor,
encompassing how the agency perceives, defines,
collects, and manages data, and the data acumen and
skills among staff to leverage data.
Legal and Policy Context
Recent laws and policies covering Federal data
management1
have challenged Federal agencies to
evaluate and improve how data are treated as a strategic
asset and made broadly available to stakeholders.
Federal agencies are reconsidering the role that data can
play in guiding the planning, operations, budget, and
management of programs. Federal policies, including
executive orders expanding the role for data in supporting

artificial intelligence2
, scientific integrity3
, and equity4
,
along with the Federal Data Strategy5
, similarly seek
to align agencies in the ways they seek to build data
capacity. The complexity of this agenda necessitates that
Federal agencies assess their current data infrastructure
and capacity, identify areas to improve and align, and
develop methods to mature their ability to define, collect,
manage, use, and share data.
Assessments of the Current
State of Data
During fiscal year (FY) 2020, DOL’s Data Board conducted
two assessments of DOL’s infrastructure, capacities, and
processes. The first was a data management maturity
model assessment of capabilities including data
management, human capital, data culture, analytics,
and technological capabilities. The assessment ranked
DOL’s capabilities as developing, with the lowest scores
in the broad areas of human capital and technology.
The second was a data skills assessment, fielded within
a maturity model framework that looked at a variety of
capabilities fundamental to effective data management
and use. The skills assessment identified specific areas to
focus on for improvement including building data talent
to better access, visualize, and analyze data. During 2022,
DOL should release its first evidence capacity assessment
describing DOL’s ability to generate and use scientific
information including statistics, evaluation, research,
and analysis to inform policy, planning, and program
administration. These assessments have shown that while
DOL is rich in data assets, it has additional work to do to
bring the full potential of those assets to the stakeholders
that we serve. The assessments provide an objective
benchmark of strengths and weaknesses to guide
planning and strategy, and ensure DOL can target actions
to remediate known weaknesses and provide tangible and
necessary improvements.

“As the Department’s Evidence Officials, we recognize the vital role
this strategy plays in promoting evidence-based decision-making.
Increasingly, our success in accomplishing the Department’s
mission is dependent on recognizing the essential role data has in
understanding the populations we serve, the current and emerging
challenges those populations face, and providing an objective
basis for efficiently and effectively targeting our resources and
efforts to those most in need. Data are central to assessing the
state of workers and the workforce, the impacts of Department
of Labor programs, and providing transparency into our actions
and the impacts that result. This Enterprise Data Strategy brings
a more central focus to the need for quality, consistency, and
availability of data to inform and influence how DOL carries out
its mission. This strategy will guide efforts to improve Federal
data management in predictable and consistent ways, and best
position us to leverage those improvements to produce evidence
that can guide strategic planning and program administration,
inform policy and support data-informed decisions.”

Stakeholders
DOL data are a product of interactions between our
programs and the public. Strategic planning for data
changes involves parties who play an important role
across the lifecycle of data. Notable stakeholders who
can provide input toward improving DOL data include:
• DOL programs staff and leadership, who define and
collect statistical, administrative, budget, grant,
and transactional data, and use it to guide program
administration;
• External governmental, public and private entities
who depend on DOL data to support their work,
support collaborative efforts and the identification
of patterns and trends that optimize data informed
decision-making;
• American workers and members of the public who
are covered by DOL regulations, jointly administer
DOL programs, or are recipients of services
originating from DOL programs;
• DOL’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and related
Information Technology (IT) operations staff, who
match needs with services, implement common
enterprise data management, and maintain
evolving capabilities;
• DOL’s senior leadership, who provide vision and
priorities for Departmental programs, use data
to monitor program impact and performance on
stakeholders and beneficiaries, and support sound
resource allocation; and
• DOL’s data governance body and network of data
stewards, who promote the value of and advocate
for more optimal data governance, and ensure that
data management and governance processes stay
practically aligned with supporting agency mission
and public benefit.
Data inform efforts to make operations appropriate,
efficient, and effective, and to measure the impact the
programs have. Stakeholder support for the ideas and
actions in this strategy is a necessary pre-requisite to
ensure that changes in data management across the
enterprise are implemented successfully, with a strong
customer focus, and in a manner that returns maximum
value to the Department as a whole and the people who
rely on its programs.

FRAMEWORK
FOR THE DATA
STRATEGY
Data are essential inputs to virtually all management
and administrative functions in Federal agencies. The
quality of outputs from mission-critical tasks — such
as strategic planning, analytics, assessment and
performance management, evidence generation,
enforcement, targeting activities, and resource
allocation — is dependent on the quality of the data
used to generate them. DOL’s data strategy identifies
a series of principles and goals meant to increase
the benefit from data operations; align agency and
departmental data, IT, and analytical projects; and
ensure that data can consistently and predictably meet
the evolving needs of governmental, public, and private
data users.
Principles Guiding DOL Data
Governance
To optimize all data-dependent operations at DOL,
the Department must commit to abiding by the FAIR
principles. These principles serve as pillars in the data
strategy, and effectively function as a “pole star” that
harmonizes and guides disparate planning, decisionmaking, and operations across the enterprise. Broad
adoption of these principles will help to ensure that
data are defined, collected, managed, and leveraged
effectively, and made public in ways that best serve the
needs of DOL and all its stakeholders.
Principle #1: Data Must Be Findable. For DOL to be a
data-informed agency, data and associated metadata
must be findable in ways that facilitate use by both
humans and computers.
Principle #2: Data Must Be Accessible. For DOL to
effectively leverage data to inform program administration,
clear instructions for accessing all data assets must be
provided, including authentication or authorization for
any restricted-use data.
Principle #3:Data Must Be Interoperable. For DOL
program data to be maximally useful across the
Department, data and metadata must abide by
common formats and standards.

Principle #4: Data Must Be Reusable. For DOL data
to support the broadest possible set of analytical use
cases, data and metadata must be well documented
and described so that they can be replicated or
combined in different settings.
By committing to the FAIR principles, the DOL puts
itself in a position to direct the necessary activities and
acquire the needed capabilities to begin to achieve the
strategic goals.
Goals for Improved Data
Governance
Growing data capacity and maturity within an
enterprise requires a commitment to cultural,
organizational, and technological change. A transition
towards more effective data management and use
requires DOL to address areas for improvement
identified through assessment; develop systems,
processes, and people who can support a more effective
data infrastructure; and maintain a consistent focus on
the central importance of data and the value it holds.

FAIR PRINCIPLES
Fig. 2: The FAIR Principles
7
Goal #1: Data Should be Considered “Open” by
Default
DOL data should be developed and managed to be
open by default. DOL should continue to maintain
and expand comprehensive inventories of data assets
to ensure people have awareness of the data DOL
produces and manages. Inventories should serve
as a clearinghouse of supporting information about
the data including content, metadata, and names of
data stewards and custodians to support data users.
Inventories and the data described in them should
be openly accessible to the greatest extent possible,
in accordance with privacy and security laws. When
data cannot be made publicly available, DOL programs
should consider offering the data through restricted
use access programs or produce an explanation for
restricting access to the data. To foster openness
and transparency, DOL should publish an enterprise
data inventory of all its data assets that includes any
restrictions on data access.
Goal #2: Data Should Be Comprehensible
Comprehensible data are those for which descriptions
of the data design, meaning, structure, format, and
provenance are available. Comprehensible data can
be correctly understood by those users who played no
role in the creation of the data. This understanding
is provided through appropriate documentation of
the data. Without this documentation, a data set
is a collection of letters and numerals without any
context for interpreting meaning within the data. With
appropriate documentation, it is possible to understand
what the data content signify, how they are produced,
how they can be used, and what restrictions there are
to their use. Documentation provides a functional and
operational framework to interpret and use the data
like a Rosetta Stone: without it, data cannot be properly
understood; with it, data are made comprehensible.
Goal #3: Data Should Be Fit for Purpose
Data are fit for purpose when any ambiguity about
their content, format, origin, and appropriate use is
eliminated. This requires evaluating several factors,
including but not limited to documentation, format,
coverage, design, quality, and access. DOL should strive
to deliver data that meet this criterion.
Goal #4: Data Should Be Readily Available in
Consistent and Predictable Ways
DOL should establish “data-as-a-service” infrastructure,
providing relevant subsets of data, on-demand, and in a
machine-readable format, allowing for direct integration
of these data into business intelligence, analytical
software and visualization systems. DOL should also
create shared services for data access and data transfer,
so data can flow from sources to services in predictable
and efficient ways. DOL should transition siloed
data systems towards common storage frameworks,
ensuring DOL staff can leverage these services and
capabilities with appropriate governance, and efficiently
establish data quality frameworks. Finally, DOL should
develop a consolidated data portal that simplifies data
access, provides a customer-focused experience, and
offers resources that allow people to confidently and
independently locate and access the data they need.
Goal #5: Data Should Be a Departmental Strategic
Asset
For data to effectively function as a departmental
strategic asset, DOL should define, manage, and collect
data in ways that support the broadest possible set
of use cases, and maximize the possibility for reuse
within the enterprise. DOL should move to create and
adopt common data structures and schemas that
increase the value of data while decreasing the costs
of data management. DOL should develop controlled
templates for common data elements and agencies
should transition towards using those data to create
interoperability, reduce analysis burden, and support
linkage of records. DOL data should conform to expected
norms in content and format. DOL programs need
to transition away from data silos and parochial data
management and embrace the idea that data become
a strategic asset when they are shared, exposed to
emerging analytical use cases, and leveraged in a variety
of ways to yield the greatest possible benefit.
8
OPERATIONALIZING
THE STRATEGY
DOL should undertake actions in a variety of areas to
improve data governance, build data capacity, expand
and improve data talent, and grow the ways in which
data can inform and support the mission. Adopting
the FAIR principles as key to planning and decisionmaking should help to ensure that even disparate
efforts are aligned towards common goals. DOL
programs should further their alignment with this
strategy by committing to collaborating through the
DOL Data Board and the Office of Data Governance
(ODG) to work across organizational lines, and
support enterprise approaches to data management,
stewardship, architecture, and utilization. Initial areas
of focus should be on organizational and cultural
change, strengthening governance, increasing data
talent, improving data documentation, modernizing
data infrastructure, integrating data management into
existing systems, and expanding data use to inform
program administration.
Organizational and Culture
Change
Implementing this strategy begins with a culture
change that places focus on the value data offer as a
departmental strategic asset. DOL agencies should
commit to collaborating with the DOL Data Board, DOL’s
CIO, and the ODG to define and implement common
definitions, formats, and quality criteria for common
data elements to ensure interoperability of data. As
DOL agencies collect, define, manage, and share data
using more standardized and optimal approaches and
for the broadest possible set of analytical use cases, DOL
data should be fit for purpose and have greater value to
inform decision-making and evidence building.
Strengthened Governance
The Department should strengthen data governance
by creating formal, defined standards for common data
elements to make data predictable and consistent, and
implementing them wherever practicable. In addition,
DOL should continue to develop the current network
of data stewards by offering training and socializing
the concepts of more optimal data management,
and demonstrating the value proposition and
cost efficiencies that come from harmonizing data
definitions, management approaches, and use patterns.
A particularly important prerequisite for improving
governance, analytics, and open data is creating
consistent and effective documentation associated with
managing DOL data sets. DOL should work through the
DOL Data Board to promote wider use of appropriate
data standards, create effective metadata, and improve
data documentation. Documentation should be
available in plain language, offer common descriptions
of the meaning of data, and expand descriptions of data
format and organization.
Developing, Recruiting, and
Maintaining Data Talent
A critical part of DOL’s Data Strategy is to create a
workforce within DOL that is educated and trained
on the theory, techniques, and infrastructure for
effective data management and innovative analytical
uses of data. To achieve this goal, DOL should define
and formalize standardized roles and position
requirements for those data-centric occupations,
align the provisioning of tools with the skill sets of
data scientists and data professionals, develop clarity
around DOL’s analytical strategy, improve planning
for the development of data teams within agencies,
and create formal career development paths for data
personnel. DOL should work to retain effective data
talent. Attrition among data staff produces tremendous
inefficiencies and leads to time spent recruiting, hiring,
and training, instead of benefitting from completed
data science work. Offering productive environments
that inspire data talent to produce innovative
analytical products, and promoting complementary
efforts to stand up communities of practice, analytical
seminars, opportunities to present analytical work
to governmental, public, and private gatherings, and
cross-program analysis opportunities can improve
the prospects for retaining data talent and fostering a
productive environment for data science to thrive.
“As Chief Information Officer, the OCIO is in support of DOL’s Data
Strategy. It aligns with OCIO’s goal to get the right data, to the right
people, at the right time in a secure manner. OCIO provides enterprisewide data and analytics services and is building a modern data platform
for DOL’s agencies to advance mission and drive innovation. The DOL
Data Strategy, coupled with leadership engagement and an enabling
operational plan, will help OCIO accelerate the centralization and
integration of DOL data to achieve operational efficiencies and improved
insights in support of evidenced based decision making and alignment
with DOL modernization activities.”
— Department of Labor Chief Information Officer Gundeep Ahluwalia

Improving the Quality of
Departmental Data
Data—essential to setting policy and delivering
efficiently and effectively on the Department’s mission
of serving America’s workforce—are often not defined,
collected, or managed in ways that best serve the needs
of DOL or its stakeholders. There needs to be a more
central focus on the quality, consistency, and availability
of data to inform and influence how DOL carries out its
mission. Data have good quality when they accurately
represent events, characteristics, activities, or outcomes
they record. DOL agencies should work through the
Data Board and collaborate with the CIO, Chief Data
Officer, and other governmental programs and agencies
to define and implement data quality standards and
practices to ensure DOL data are fit for purpose and
interoperable. Uniform standards and practices
for managing data are essential for establishing,
maintaining, and improving data quality throughout the
Department.
Integrating Data as a Priority
into Existing Management
Systems
Improving data governance and data management is
a complex process that often requires integration with
organizational, budgeting, operational, personnel, and
technological systems and processes. Institutionalizing
changes requires integrating them into existing
processes for strategic planning, resource allocation,
and establishing priorities for staffing and IT. DOL will
establish a process to have agencies integrate agencyspecific and Departmental data projects they are
undertaking to better manage and leverage data into
their annual budget operating and Agency Management
Plans. Adding data projects to Agency Management
Plans explicitly links improved data management
and use with agency mission, and integrates data
into existing frameworks for budget planning and
management, IT priority setting, staffing priorities, and
performance management systems with metrics and
milestones for the work to be done. This approach
avoids creation of new administrative process and
generates efficient and effective integration of data into
well-understood and closely monitored management
systems. DOL will consolidate those agency plans into
an annual data plan that includes both agency and
Departmental priorities, and make this plan available to
the public on an annual basis.
Expanding Analytical
Capabilities to Leverage
Data to Inform Planning
and Administration
DOL should develop a plan for enhancing and
expanding the tools and capabilities that support
exploration, analysis, visualization, and prediction
systems using data. These tools are essential to
DOL’s ability to effectively leverage data, recruit and
retain data talent to support our program offices,
and promote innovation in the ways data are used to
develop evidence and program-relevant insights. In
combination with improved data quality and methods
for data access, improved analytical capabilities
should help DOL create products that turn data into
information and insights that more optimally guide
planning, actions, and resource allocation. Increasing
the quality and quantity of analytical work also
reinforces the strategic value and importance of data
to the people who collect and manage it, and serves as
valuable feedback.
11
PUTTING
STRATEGY INTO
PRACTICE
A number of specific and ongoing actions illustrate
DOL’s commitment to making progress towards the
principles and goals identified in this strategy, and
are designed to bring benefit to the administration
of Federal programs as well as to generate improved
data and data products for all of DOL’s stakeholders,
including:
First-ever Open Data Request for Information (RFI):
To understand the needs of workers and the myriad
of stakeholders who consume our data, DOL will
issue its first-ever Open Data RFI to solicit comments,
feedback, and suggestions from the public for targeted
improvements on data quality, availability, and modes
of access.
Further Develop Workforce Scorecards and
Dashboards: DOL continues to leverage data to
create and explore more optimal formats and content
for workforce scorecards describing the efficacy of
workforce development programs across the country.
These tools will generate more optimal outcomes for
numerous stakeholders in employment and training
programs; from workers seeking the best-fit for training,
to businesses looking for the best sources of talent, to
providers working to make their services more effective
and efficient.
Combine and Improve Enforcement Data for Public
Consumption: Based on recommendations from the
Worker Empowerment and Organizing Taskforce, DOL
will create more interoperable and integrated data
products by linking enforcement data across programs
so the public can understand how companies are
meeting their obligations under law.
Working Across Stakeholders to Modernize the LMI
System: The Labor Market Information ecosystem
across the country is a vital source of information for
everyone from workers to policymakers, especially
during shocks such as the recent pandemic. DOL seeks
to bolster and strengthen this system and the partners
inside and outside of government that support it, with
the goal of making the entire system more responsive
and more transparent around the state of all workers.
12
SUMMARY
Modernizing perspectives on the value of data and
increasing the sophistication of DOL data operations
requires a comprehensive approach that includes
working with data, people, culture, analytics, and
technology. DOL should take a comprehensive
approach to reframe the role of data that includes
reinforcing the importance of designing for quality,
accessibility, and utility in infrastructure, ensuring the
quality and utility of data are appropriately central to
emerging priorities, and maintaining focus on who we
serve with our data.
Whether the intent is to optimize internal program
operations, provide transparency into the impacts
and beneficiaries of governmental programs, or create
greater value for all public, private, and governmental
data users, DOL should place a more central focus on
ensuring that data provide maximum value, can be
conveniently found, comprehensively understood, and
confidently used. Findable, accessible, interoperable,
and reusable data promote the delivery of efficient
and effective services to the public, advances the
management of Government information as an asset,
and fuels entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific
discovery that optimally supports administration of DOL
programs, meets agency mission, and brings benefit to
DOL’s core customers.
