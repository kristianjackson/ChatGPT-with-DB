for ?t JJ-12.€ ~~'~1\.1 ..: '--LC '1 1 #1pq__ds,
Border Patrol Hiring.-The agreement provides funding for 19,855 Border Patrol agents, an
increase of 300 above the level funded in fiscal year 2022. In light of the Border Patrol's ongoing
19
recruitment and attrition challenges, funding that is unable to be executed for new hiring in fiscal
year 2023 is available for additional targeted Border Patrol Agent hiring and retention efforts;

Shelter and Services Program.-The agreement provides $800,000,000 for a Shelter and
Services Program (SSP) to support CBP in effectively managing noncitizen processing and
preventing the overcrowding of short-term CBP holding facilities. Within the total amount
20
provided, up to $50,000,000 is available for the construction or expansion of shelter facilities.
The funds are transferred to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for
administration as grants or cooperative agreements with state and local governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
During fiscal year 2023, a portion of this funding may be used for the existing Emergency
Food and Shelter Program-Humanitarian (EFSP-H) in order to provide time for CBP and FEMA
to establish a funding allocation process for the SSP. While the Emergency Food and Shelter
National Board has performed admirably in administering EFSP-H since it was first funded in
fiscal year 2019, funding the SSP through CBP will facilitate more effective support of CBP
efforts to efficiently process and humanely treat noncitizens. It also acknowledges the existing
vital partnership between CBP and NGOs.
Prior to EFSP-H, many NGOs and local communities already provided shelter and other
services to individuals released directly from CBP custody, helping to facilitate the humane and
respectful treatment of noncitizens undergoing processing at CBP facilities, including families,
while minimizing impacts on local border communities. Overcrowding at CBP short-term
holding facilities has negative impacts on noncitizens and makes it more difficult for CBP
personnel to carry out their duties. This partnership also serves American taxpayers by
minimizing the need to expand the capacity of existing CBP facilities.
Not less than quarterly, CBP shall provide data to FEMA to help inform decisions on where
funding should be provided to shelters along the southwest border and in the interior of the
United States to support CBP's border security mission. At a minimum, this data shall include
historical data and future projections of encounters of families and single adults, by POE and
Border Patrol sector.

safe, humane, and orderly processing of single adults, families, and unaccompanied children in
CBP custody, in compliance with the CBP National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention,
and Search as well as the Flores Settlement. The report shall also describe CBP efforts to
improve stakeholder monitoring and access policies at CBP facilities. These directives should
21
not be construed to interfere with the rights obtained, or obligations owed, under any federal
consent decree.
Transportation Checks and Roving Enforcement.-In addition to direction in House Report
117-396, the required reporting shall include the total amount of drugs, currency, and firearms
seized as a result of transportation checks.

potential opportunities for partnership with non-profit and private entities. CBP shall provide a
report to the Committees within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act with such
recommendations.

396.
To date, CBP has failed to request any funding to address unfunded requirements for civil
works, installation, and site prep for previously funded NII equipment to be deployed in preprimary lanes at LPOEs, which could require more than an additional $200,000,000. While the
agreement provides additional funding for the NII program, CBP and OHS are encouraged to
request funds in future budgets to address this shortfall.
To ensure proper oversight of NII funds, CBP shall also continue to provide monthly updates
to the Committees on the obligation of funds for NII equipment, along with actual and projected
performance gains as a result of NII deployments funded in this or prior appropriations. Within
30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a briefing to the Committees on
the status of NII coverage in pre-primary lanes along the southwest border. The briefing should
32
address how an increase in pre-primary screening will impact current secondary inspection
capacity and the workflow of other federal agencies that may not have sufficient time to plan for
additional resource needs.
Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, CBP shall provide a report on
the current status of mobile NII technology and proposals for enhancing it.
CBP is reminded of the reporting requirement on 100 percent scanning in the joint
explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year 2022 funding Act, which was due to
