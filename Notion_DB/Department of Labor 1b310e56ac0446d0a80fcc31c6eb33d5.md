# **Major Components of Data Governance at DOL**

DOL has established a federated data governance model that recognizes our component agencies as generators and owners of data and relies on DOL’s representative data governance body (the [DOL Data Board](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-board)) and our data stewardship network to lead our varying programs towards more optimal data management through consensus, collaboration, and increasingly more rigorous data management.

DOL has numerous key stakeholders who are critical to the ways in which DOL routinely manages, leverages, and shares data including DOL’s Chief Information Officer, Evidence Officials, agency and Departmental leadership teams, and other Federal, public, and private data users who rely on data we produce every day to best inform our collective work in public service.

Major components of our governance efforts include:

- establishing [strategy](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/strategy) so varying programs and activities are aligned towards common goals;
- [assessments](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/assessment) to ensure that our efforts are addressing the most pressing issues, and everyone is aware of the current state of our infrastructure and operations;
- creating a comprehensive [inventory](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/inventory) of data collections created, maintained, and controlled by the Department of Labor;
- standards to help ensure interoperability, predictability and consistency; and
- awareness of all relevant laws and policies governing data use and management.

# **Background**

Maintaining clear and useful inventories of data across the enterprise is a foundational prerequisite for establishing an effective data governance program.  Prior to assessing the current state of data capabilities, developing data strategies, or establishing standards, an organization requires a comprehensive understanding of the format, content, and variety of data assets that need to be governed, where they can be accessed, how they are made available, etc.  Below are links to products that DOL has created to support more effective and effective management of data assets.  These products have been specifically designed to be useful to the public and support their efforts to locate, access and leverage the data and information they seek.

# **Enterprise Data Inventory**

DOL's [Enterprise Data Inventory](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/enterprise-data-inventory) (EDI) is a comprehensive list of data collections created, maintained, and controlled by the Department of Labor.  Our EDI contains a variety of information including data stewards who have specific responsibilities for data management, data set descriptors provided to data.gov, and additional characteristics and categorizations that are useful in describing content, format and special features within the datasets.

Please note that this list excludes public and private data sets created and managed by our Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  For access to BLS data sets, visit them at [https://www.bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/), or submit questions about BLS datasets directly at [https://www.bls.gov/bls/contact.htm](https://www.bls.gov/bls/contact.htm).

# **Tags and Keywords**

During 2021 and 2022, DOL undertook [Tags and Keywords](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/taxonomy). These are a collection of controlled vocabularies (CVs) used to standardize the way that agencies describe their datasets to make related datasets easily discoverable.

# **Taxonomy**

DOL’s [Taxonomy](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/taxonomy) is a hierarchical structure of standardized terms and concepts describing data that enables users to find and use related datasets.

# **What is the Enterprise Data Inventory?**

The Enterprise Data Inventory (EDI) is a core component of any effective data governance program, and provides a comprehensive listing of data assets that are generated, managed, and used in support of Agency missions.  DOL's EDI is managed through collaborative efforts involving staff from data governance staff across the Department in coordination with DOL's Data Board.

# **How do Enterprise Data Inventories Help?**

- An effective EDI will organize, categorize, and summarize the information being collected, managed, analyzed, and made public throughout the Department.
- EDI will provide useful information to both internal and external data users such as the names of datasets, brief descriptions of their content and purpose, links to where the data can be accessed, and some details regarding how often the data are being published, updated, and released.
- The EDI identifies key individuals who play important roles with respect to the data including but not limited to:
    - Data stewards who can provide detailed information about the dataset and the collection process that created it;
    - Data owners who have the authority to make decisions about sharing the data;
    - Managers of IT systems that host the data; and
    - Data users with detailed knowledge about how to appropriately leverage the data
- A well organized EDI provides a quick and useful reference to identifying data that might be beneficial for analytics, research, policy, planning or budget purposes, to support program operations, answering questions from the members of the media, and supporting greater transparency in federal data for the public

DOL also maintains a current and accurate listing of its data assets at [https://data.gov/](https://data.gov/).

# **Challenges With Finding Federal Data**

Across the Federal government, identifying and locating desired data on programs can be very challenging.  Important dimensions of leveraging data such as modes of access, the condition and quality of documentation, and services to support the findability of data vary considerably by agency or data source.  Federal and private inventory programs such as data.gov improve the situation by offering a single, common interface, and a rapid way to search across many agencies and data sources. However, even with such services, success in identifying data by guessing the right keywords or domains to engage in meaningful search will depend on experience, knowledge, skill, or luck.

To better understand this challenge at DOL, ODG staff performed comparisons between (1) the keywords and descriptors that DOL agencies offer with their public data resources, (2) search terms that the public frequently enters into agency websites to try to find data, and (3) search terms entered into popular internet search engines.  This comparison found almost no overlap between the search terms used by the public to find DOL data, and the language used by DOL programs to describe their public data offerings.

DOL agencies often operate with a vocabulary of technical terms with specific, legal meanings that describe events, actions, actors, and outcomes in their data.  These terms derive from laws and policies related to the mission and work of each DOL program.  While DOL programs produce many data sets that are readily available and potentially useful for a broad swath of public, private, and other Federal data users, it can be difficult for people without intimate knowledge of these terms and vocabularies to discover the specific data they want or need efficiently.  A resource to help users understand these special terms, and to facilitate more direct methods for data location is needed.

# **DOL Leads Efforts to Make Data More Findable**

ODG and DOL’s Data Board lead efforts to develop a standard, plain-language approach to describing data sets.  These efforts began with comprehensive reviews of DOL’s data, and various data categorization, keyword, and tagging systems.  This work ultimately led to the creation of a simple and unified data description system that makes DOL data more findable and includes:

- Taxonomy: clear, plain-language categories and sub-categories to describe data, a focus on comprehensibility for outside users, and linking parochial categories and terms to a broader or more generic set of concepts (i.e. actions, actors, events, outcomes); and
- Controlled Vocabularies: a prespecified set of descriptors across all programs and systems to describe data that ensures predictable and consistent tagging and identification.

# **How do Taxonomy and Controlled Vocabulary Help?**

Taxonomy simplifies search by providing a consistent and predictable set of categories in which keywords exist such as reporting forms, laws associated with the collection, descriptors of actors (who) described in the data along with events and outcomes (what happened), and descriptors of the specificity and coverage of data elements such as geographic variables within the data.

Controlled vocabularies provide a complete set of searchable terms within a category, so users can identify appropriate search terms and use those search terms to identify DOL data sets with characteristics, format, or content that they want.  Examples of taxonomy categories, and the vocabulary terms within that can support more natural search for data of interest include:

- Data sources associated with specific laws such as Civil Rights Act, The Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act;
- General descriptors of the content and themes represented within the data such as benefits, child labor, enforcement, health insurance, labor unions, legal, financial, budget, grants, emergency response, etc.;
- Practical and logistical aspects of the data such as frequency of update (e.g. annual, quarterly, weekly, daily), data file formats and the organizational structure of the data itself (e.g. event history data, relational data and the fields to link it, text/narrative data, administrative data in rectangular layouts, etc.); and
- Fields that are useful for linking or categorizing data such as geographical indicators and classification schemes (NAICS, DUNS, EIN, SOC, etc.)

Below are links to download files with DOL's tag and keyword along with the controlled vocabulary

# **The Value in Enterprise Governance of Tags and Keywords**

Like other important data governance functions, making data descriptions more predictable and consistent reduces the burden of data management and administration within government, and makes data more findable and accessible, as well as more comprehensible for those outside of DOL.  Some important benefits for a wide range of stakeholders include:

- Simplifying complex and parochial semantics across programs and systems;
- Providing an aid to understanding the terms of the special language of DOL work;
- Providing more effective and efficient methods for locating data; and
- Clarifying what categories and terms to use in search to generate optimal results

In addition, by integrating the taxonomy and controlled vocabulary with our enterprise data inventory, we offer the public a clear framework to search for data sets and variables across the enterprise in a way that can be maximally simple and efficient for them, and more readily locate data and data stewardship that can help advance their intended goals.  In addition, by enhancing the comprehensibility of data, and ease in finding data related to specific laws, events, programs, or missions, we increase the ability to integrate DOL data with other data sources, both inside and outside the department, and potentially return the greatest value to the Department and its stakeholders.

Below are links to download a list of available DOL Data sets with tags and keywords from our controlled vocabulary that will help users identify the data the are trying to find.

# **The Value of Assessment**

Assessments are a fundamental prerequisite for effective planning and management. Assessment measures capabilities, adherence to policy, progress towards goals, and maturity in data governance process and practice.  Without assessment, organizations would not be able to establish a meaningful data strategy because they would lack clear, objective, comprehensive, and accurate benchmarks of current data capabilities.  Assessments can distinguish between areas in which organizations are strong or meeting goals, and areas that are limiters and may need change.

While [strategy](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/strategy) acts as a department-wide pole star to identify goals, assessment identifies the amount of progress being made toward those goals.  In addition, assessments serve a vital function though their objective and neutral measurement to help lead people to common understandings of inefficiencies or barriers, and support building consensus towards more optimal or improved processes.  Described below are the Data Management Maturity, Skills, and Digital Transformation assessments that DOL conducted to inform strategic planning and move the Department towards more effective and optimal data management and use. 

# **Data Management Maturity Model Assessments**

Assessing capabilities and maturity in areas like data, analytics, people, technology, and organizational culture enables agencies to prioritize issues of greatest concern and evaluate where investments of limited resources can have the largest impact. To learn more about DOL’s current capabilities and maturity, and recent work being done to improve these, see information on [DOL’s Data Maturity Assessment](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-management-maturity-model).

# **Skills Assessment**

Improving staff data skills enables agencies to turn data into information that can inform decision making and program administration. To learn more about DOL’s efforts to assess the skills needed to effectively define, collect and manage data, current inventories of staff capabilities with those skills, and ongoing efforts to close critical skills gaps, read the results of [DOL’s Skills Assessment](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/skills-assessment).

# **Digital Transformation**

DOL recently worked closely with the Partnership for Public Service to leverage their Federal Data and Digital Maturity Index.  This instrument is similar to a data management maturity model assessment, but expands on the ways in which appraisals are done and allows agencies to identify both a current level of maturity and a desired level of maturity.  This assessment covers 29 baseline dimensions with a focused view on people as a resource and our ability to execute in an environment that is becoming increasingly technical and data-dependent.  You can see the results of the Labor Department Assessment [Here](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/2021%20Labor%20Department%20FDDMI%20Results.pdf).

# **Overview**

The [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) requires that agencies conduct data management maturity assessments.  These assessments are useful in evaluating existing data management processes and capabilities, identifying how they meet mission needs, and suggesting opportunities for improvement. During FY2020, DOL developed a maturity assessment tool based off of the [Advanced Analytics Capability Maturity Model (A2CM2)](https://www.ssa.gov/data/data_governance_board/ACE_A2CM2_for%20DGB.pptx.pdf).

# **Significant Components of Data Management Maturity**

DOL assessed maturity in five core areas of data management including: data, analytics, technology, people, and culture.

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/dmmm-elements2.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/dmmm-elements2.PNG)

# **How Do We Measure Maturity?**

The maturity scale in the models we use ranges from 1 (lowest level of capability) to 5 (highest level of capability).

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/dmmm-maturity-scale.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/dmmm-maturity-scale.PNG)

- The lowest category (level 1) reflects capabilities we do not have, or processes that are locally managed, and operating in an ad hoc manner based on whatever existing resources and tools are available without respect to what anyone else in the enterprise does.
- The highest category (level 5) indicates a capability or process that is well understood with respect to process and perceived value, staff are trained and knowledgeable in its use, and the process is sophisticated, automated, standardized, and optimized across the whole enterprise.
- Categories 2 through 4 identify intermediate steps between lowest to highest, and form a continuum or gradient reflecting incremental progress toward higher levels of capability.

# **Maturity Assessment Results**

The results of DOL’s assessment using this model ranked overall capabilities as developing with an average score of 2; the lowest scores being in people and technology (1.9) and the highest scores being in data (2.3). 

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/images/dmmm-results.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/images/dmmm-results.PNG)

| Element | Score |
| --- | --- |
| People | 1.90 |
| Technology | 1.93 |
| Analytics | 1.99 |
| Culture | 2.08 |
| Data | 2.34 |

# **Key Findings**

Areas identified as relatively lower in maturity and targeted for improvement and more optimal data management, process, and use include:

- Data - data documentation (1.9) and metadata management (2.0)
- Analytics – selection criteria for analytics projects (1.6) and management of analytical projects in a way maximizes impact on organizational needs (1.6)
- Technology – internal lifecycle development process to support analytical tools (1.5)
- People – profiling and sourcing data talent (1.5)
- Culture – leadership engagement and value of data as a strategic asset to support evidence based decision making (1.5)

Assessment reveals that for DOL to progress in maturity, it is critically important to invest in foundational capabilities such as building data talent, standardizing data management across the enterprise, improving documentation, establishing an effective metadata framework, and standardizing technological lifecycle processes specific to the development of advanced analytical tools.

Many of the areas for improvement are centered around supporting organizational cultural change, from basic data collection and management up through program leadership, to value data as a strategic asset, ensuring all data are fit for purpose and can be used throughout the enterprise in predictable and consistent ways.  The Office of Data Governance is supporting this work through a number of channels of activity including but not limited to:

- Establishing [Data Governance Roles](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-board) like agency Chief Data Stewards who effectively collaborate on DOL Data Board projects and engage with their agency leadership to bring about the kind of culture change needed to advance data as a strategic asset.
- Developing an [Enterprise Data Inventory](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/enterprise-data-inventory) to understand the breadth of data assets that need to be described and managed.
- Founding a Metadata Schema for describing DOL datasets in a consistent and predictable way to ensure that data are interoperable across the enterprise.
- Creating a controlled vocabulary containing Tags and keyword for categorizing datasets to ensure data are easily findable within DOL.
- Incorporating a data theme into Agency Management Plans with guidance on data projects (e.g. data governance, talent, use, and access) that align work with agency and departmental priorities to return the greatest value to DOL and its stakeholders.
- Forming [Data Board Working Groups](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-board) around data talent, equity, data-informed enforcement, and analytics.
- Collaborating with Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) partners on the development lifecycle of transformational technological capabilities that support open data, data sharing, and advanced analytical capabilities.

# **Evolving Work**

Data Governance is more of a process than a project, and as such, it is constantly evolving in response to changing requirements, emerging technology and risks, and evolving capabilities and awareness of how data can best be leveraged to bring value to the enterprise.  DOL’s strategic planning and proposed activities to support higher levels of data management maturity over the next three years can be found in the [DOL Data Strategy](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/DOL-Enterprise-Data-Strategy-2022.pdf).

# **Overview**

Increasingly, the success of our programs in accomplishing their mission is dependent on recognizing the essential role data has in understanding the populations we serve, the current and emerging challenges those populations face, and providing an objective basis for efficiently and effectively targeting our resources and efforts to those most in need.  Data are central to assessing the state of workers and the workforce, developing policy and planning for Department of Labor programs, guiding program administration, and providing transparency into our actions and the impacts that result.

Just as we can optimally guide data governance with inputs from data management maturity models, we can use objective measures of strengths and weaknesses in analytical skills to guide efforts building capabilities to leverage data and enhance data literacy and data culture.  Systematic assessment of data skills supports objective evaluation of current capacities, identifies meaningful distinctions in data literacy, recognizes strengths, detects areas for improvement, and outlines a path toward developing and leveraging the necessary skills to use data as a strategic asset.

# **Skills Assessment Instrument**

DOL has conducted comprehensive Skills Assessment that includes five components:

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/skills-instrument.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/skills-instrument.PNG)

# **Assessment Results**

The skills assessment was conducted with categories similar to those found in a maturity model framework, ensuring people used skill progressions with clearly differentiated tiers to identify their current state.  Data skills were assessed in the following areas:

- Ability to obtain, verify, clean, analyze, visualize, communicate, assess, and interpret data
- Perception of organizational data culture
- Awareness of data ethics and security

The maturity scale used to score each area ranged from 1 (low level of data literacy skills) to 5 (data fluency). Levels 2 through 4 identify intermediate steps between lowest to highest, and form a continuum or gradient reflecting incremental progress toward higher levels of data literacy skills.

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/skills-maturity-scale.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/skills-maturity-scale.PNG)

Assessment results across all data skill generally fell into the evolving or enlightened category. Data management and use skills in which DOL was relatively stronger included reviewing data and analytical results, data culture, and data ethics and security. Data management and use skills in which DOL was relatively weaker included skills associated with accessing or obtaining data, visualizing data, and analyzing data.

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/images/skills-assessment-results.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/images/skills-assessment-results.PNG)

| Skill | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Reviewing data and analytical results | 3.90 |
| Data culture | 3.88 |
| Data ethics and security | 3.77 |
| Verify data are fit for purpose | 3.46 |
| Organize analytical work around data | 3.45 |
| Locate and access data | 3.21 |
| Assess, clean or prepare | 3.20 |
| Communicate data or analysis results | 3.16 |
| Analyze data | 2.98 |
| Visualize data | 2.75 |
| Access or obtain data | 2.38 |

DOL's skill assessment also identified a number of key aspects of talent development and learning modes, which the Data Board has emphasized as core to guide plans for future learning, training, and skill improvement .  These findings include:

- Identification of specific areas of training that would have immediate impact and be most practically helpful to DOL staff such as furthering their ability to analyze and visualize data;
- Identification of specific strategic skills that would best support transformation towards a data-informed culture and fostering an environment that supported innovation;
- DOL staff expressed a strong preference for experiential learning models, and specifically learning by doing and performing a series of exercises with known outcomes; and
- The skills assessment also identified some critical limiters to achieving better analytical and data management work. The issues most commonly cited included limitation in data reuse as a result of data quality issues, lack of predictable and consistent data infrastructure to process, combine or stage data for analysis, and the degree to which data produced is suitable and fit-for-purpose to innovate on service delivery.

# **Using Assessment Results to Guide Improvements**

The results of the Skills Assessment reveal that for DOL to continue to improve data acumen and fluency, and leverage data more effectively to inform program administration, greater investment is needed in data governance to improve the quality and suitability of data, data infrastructure to access, obtain, analyze and visualize data, and a data-informed culture that fosters and promotes innovation. 

DOL's Office of Data Governance is leading several initiatives to build data skills, culture and capacity, including but not limited to:

- **Address validation, standardization, and geocoding** efforts to make data interoperable for cross-linkage of records across agency datasets and suitable for geospatial visualization and analysis.
- Developing data infrastructure and services through **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** for agency staff to find, access, and extract data in consistent and predictable ways.
    - APIs enable staff to retrieve customizable subsets of data on demand in machine readable formats and to create reusable, automated, and real-time data pipelines that feed into analytical workflows and data-driven dashboards.
    - APIs have also enabled ODG to identify data quality issues and work with agencies to understand how to make data more comprehensible and useful.
- Expanding access to enterprise **analytical services** with a comprehensive approach to prototyping, assessing, maintaining, and deploying software in a manner that maximizes responsiveness to the needs of DOL staff;
- Creating **data visualization tools** that make it easy for staff of all skill levels to prototype and share important trends and patterns in program impact, stakeholder characteristics, and agency services;
- Establishing **communities of practice** for analytics, APIs, and data visualization, which promote knowledge sharing, collaboration on best practices, and applied experiential learning exercises to build practical data skills needed for day-to-day agency data operations. These communities have proven to be an effective way to build the data culture at DOL and grow innovative ideas, processes, and products.
- Offering **training classes and workshops** in using open-source software like R and Python through DOL’s analytical services to prototype interactive data visualization, dashboards, and analytical workflows.

# **The Importance of Data Strategy**

Virtually all guidance on establishing high performing and effective data governance programs relies on critical components such as executive support and effective data stewardship networks.  One of the most significant components is establishing meaningful strategy.  An effective data strategy functions as a pole star, guiding various programs, missions, and management approaches towards more optimal, consistent, and useful processes and products.  Building consensus around an effective strategy is particularly important in cases where little data consolidation will occur, data are heavily siloed in their definition, collection and use, and governance will be established under a [federated model](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-governance).

Within DOL, data strategy was developed with broad consensus and implemented to:

- Clearly articulate enterprise goals for data and the expected value of improved operations;
- Appropriately prioritize the importance of data in major lines of business including IT, budget, performance management, goal setting, training, and personnel management;
- Align local data management decisions to enterprise goals, methods, and standards; and
- Integrate strategic goals for data into existing planning, administration, budget, and management systems.

# **DOL’s Enterprise Data Strategy**

DOL formalized its first [Enterprise Data Strategy](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/DOL-Enterprise-Data-Strategy-2022.pdf) in April of 2022.  The Enterprise Data Strategy is informed by the numerous laws, policies and guidance on Federal data management, prior [assessments](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/assessment) of data management maturity and data skills to objectively describe areas in need of improvement, and recognition of the diverse set of stakeholders who are central to this work and will benefit from enhancements.

The framework for the strategy builds off the foundation of missions and laws that guide the Department, and is composed of four guiding principles (the FAIR principles) and five goals that can develop more consistent and effective data governance and align Departmental and agency planning to improve data management and use capabilities.  Taken together, the foundation, principles, and goals form a strategy that should guide decision-making, project planning, and data governance, and incrementally improve the state of data at DOL.

![https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/strategy-parthenon-image.PNG](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/strategy-parthenon-image.PNG)

The strategy concludes with focused areas for improvement at the agency and Departmental level including:

- ensuring data quality;
- building and maintaining data talent;
- integration of data into existing agency management and planning systems to create a practical and realizable path forward; and
- expanding the data capabilities for producing sophisticated analytics.

# **Implementing Improved Data Governance**

[Secretary’s Order 02-2019](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/03/26/2019-05720/secretarys-order-02-2019-chief-data-officer-and-dol-data-board) described the state of DOL data when the Office of Data Governance was established in the following way:

*“Across the agencies within the Department of Labor, data—which are essential to setting policy and delivering efficiently and effectively on the Department's mission of serving America's workforce—are collected every day. However, these data may not be leveraged, housed, formatted, or made public in ways that best serve the needs of DOL or its stakeholders. There needs to be a more central focus on the quality, consistency, and availability of data to inform and influence how DOL carries out its mission.”*

DOL’s Data Board confirmed this in 2020 through two assessments of data infrastructure, culture, and use, with results broadly indicating lower levels of maturity (informal to evolving). [Data management assessments](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/data-management-maturity-model) identified specific areas for improvement including: data documentation; data governance and access; prototyping new analytics; identifying, obtaining and retaining data talent; and better leadership for data projects.  [Data skills assessment](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/dg/skills-assessment) identified specific areas for improvement including building data talent, and developing more efficient and effective methods for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing data.  The assessment results have helped inform DOL’s transition towards creating data that better supports agency and Departmental priorities, creates more effective analytical products, more time and cost-efficient sharing and use, and brings the greatest value to the broadest set of stakeholders.

DOL’s data strategy recognizes agency ownership of data, seeking to align individual agency activities towards more effective enterprise governance and management.  Instead of creating additional and potentially burdensome management systems, DOL has pursued a strategy for prioritizing and integrating data into existing strategic planning, budget, performance, and personnel management systems.  In some cases, agencies are already taking actions to review and leverage their data, and building teams that can further these abilities.  In other cases, new agency or Departmental priorities have identified needs to create and manage new data, examine existing data, or repurpose external data to guide projects and planning.

In preparation for 2023 and beyond, DOL’s Enterprise Data Strategy will serve as a major input and theme in agency management plans, formally integrates it into agency systems, describes improved data governance in a way that links it to agency or Departmental mission and goals, and documents the transition towards better data stewardship; more research, analytical use, and innovation in the use of internal and external data; and better use and development of data talent.

The principles and goals in [Secretary’s Order 02-2019](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/03/26/2019-05720/secretarys-order-02-2019-chief-data-officer-and-dol-data-board), and the DOL’s Enterprise Data Strategy will guide current and prospective efforts across agencies to create and improve capabilities, support better alignment of data operations, develop more effective data  management, and encourage greater use of data to inform program administration and decision-making.

# **Geospatial Data Strategy**

DOL formalized its first Geospatial Data Strategy in April of 2021 and is the first of 13 requirements for covered agencies detailed at 43 USC 46 Sec. 2808(a)(1). While DOL’s mission does not involve or require geospatial data generation, management, or use, the Department would directly benefit from developing more systematic data governance of any address or location data it does collect, and aligning such governance around appropriate enterprise data management policy.  The Department’s primary approach to implementation is to create a shared service for address standardization, address validation and geocoding of location data, and to start integrating this service into legacy and prospective data collections to begin building geospatial data capacity.    As the Department establishes data that can be leveraged in geospatial application and analysis, DOL’s data governance body will work to identify training, opportunities, and tools to leverage the strategic value in that data for program administration, policymaking, and resource allocation.

Link to [DOL’s Geospatial Data Strategy](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/Data-Governance/Department%20of%20Labor%20Geospatial%20Data%20Strategy.pdf).

# **Background**

Secretary’s Order (SO) 02-2019 formalized the DOL Data Board (DOLDB) as a representative data governance body where issues relating to improving data quality, data management and data use are collaboratively addressed through consensus building, adopting best practices, and innovating appropriate solutions.  From its inception, the Data Board has been a highly effective forum for addressing complex data issues in a collegial and productive way, recognizing the need for more standardized and optimal approaches to data management and use, and building data capacity towards the goal of leveraging data as a strategic asset.

# **Charter / Secretary's Order 02-2019**

[DOL Data Board Charter](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/03/26/2019-05720/secretarys-order-02-2019-chief-data-officer-and-dol-data-board)

# **Data Board Roles**
